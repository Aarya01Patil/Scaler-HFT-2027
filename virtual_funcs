virtual functions is the way
copy eliision quiz

virtual pointer 
emplace in vector
why is it used

std::vector<int> v3 = makeVector(); // returned temporary also copied
perfmance ipmact with 
CRTP vs virtuals 
n C++, expressions fall into categories:

lvalue → has a name, addressable (x, *p, etc.)

prvalue → pure rvalue, temporary (42, makeObj())

xvalue → “expiring value”, usually std::move(x)


.cancel getting called 
with GTC orders and IOC orders both



show gobolts that now compiler doesn't know which function it has to call
https://godbolt.org/



g++ -O0 -S nonvirtual.cpp -o nonvirtual.s
g++ -O0 -S virtual.cpp -o virtual.s

Layout of an Order object:
+--------------------+
| vptr (8 bytes)     |  ---> points to Order's vtable in memory
+--------------------+
| id   (4 bytes)     |
+--------------------+
| side (4 bytes)     |
+--------------------+

vtable
vptr
extra over head of it
A variable with a name is always an lvalue, no matter if it’s int, int&, or int&&.

If you want to treat a named T&& as an rvalue again, you must use std::move.
at runtime it is decided which function gets called
CRTP to solve the same problem 
move semantics with all compiler flags off
 




Move semantics 

show an example with all compiler flags off the amount  of copie it does



now use std::move()...... make them visualise it how it works under the hood etc etc 


how it is faster and stuff 

with some comlex example right ...


see latency difference in both


MOVE ASSIGNMENT

MOVE CONSTRUCTOR


TAKE EXAMPLE OF VECTOR CLASS 

COPY CONSTRUCTOR

custom VECTOR CLASS

HOW REALLOCATIONS ARE DONE .... MEMORY ALLOCATOR .... MOVE SEMANTICS ETC ETC 

AND STUDY THIS OK
